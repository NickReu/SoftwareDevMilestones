The following is what we did at our stand up meeting. We chose specific architecture, chose to deploy on Heroku App, chose Node JS for the middle layer, chose PostgreSQL for the database. And choose to use python for the machine learning and training our algorithm. We then discussed our roles before next meeting. Milan is going to assemble training data for images, Josh will look into neural network options and libraries, Owen will assemble more meme text training data, Kyle will look into using NodeJS as a middle layer between database and web page. The biggest obstacle we discussed was how our neural network will work and what data we will use to train the neural network. At the last meeting we created the 3 week sprint and unable to retrospectively look at something we just started.
